# Arduino_MidiUsbDrumBrain
Project makes a usb midi interface for 6 inputs. This was made because my guitar hero drum kit does not forward midi off messages so even though the PS's interface box has a physical midi i/o ports they are useless to nearly everybody. I just wanted a quick solution to this problem.
